    <p>Hi, my name is Gabriel,<br>
        my hobby is learning programming,<br>
        and my desire is to turn the hobby into a profession,<br>
        and here I want to start my process.<br>
        I will also publish the journey to success on the networks.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>I have a high school education, including 12 years of study, with a specialization in Communication and Cinema.

        <h2>Over the years, I have pursued additional fields of study:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> I attended evening classes in 3D animation and digital sculpting.</li>
            <li>Later, I transitioned to studying architecture.</li>
            <li> Currently, I am studying Interior Design as part of a certification program at Studio 6B College.</li>
        </ul>
        Additionally, my main hobby, which I frequently engage in, is programming. I hope that in the future, I will be able to turn this hobby into a profession.        
    </p>
    <p>I currently do not have professional experience, achievements, or specific skills in the field yet. However, I am actively learning and developing my abilities, and I am committed to updating my progress as I gain new knowledge, skills, and accomplishments.
